# GLITCHDLE 

Glitchdle is a unique twist on the classic five-letter word-guessing format popularized by Wordle. In Glitchdle, players must navigate through various modes where glitches randomly alter the feedback, adding an extra layer of challenge and unpredictability.    

## mode 1 - Timed correct   
Randomly mark one letter incorrectly and correct it after the next guess.  

## mode 2 - Detectors     
Randomly mark one letter incorrectly.    
*hard mode: no detectors*   

## mode 3 - Dice rolls -- under construction    
Chances of no glitch, one glitch, and two glitches.    
*hard mode: no hints*
